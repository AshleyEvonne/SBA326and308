SBA 326


Working on this Bootstrap project has been a rollercoaster of challenges and emotions. Working through the complexities of front-end development while harnessing Bootstrap's framework proved to be both daunting and rewarding. After watching a couple of videos I statred to grasp more knowledge on how bootstrap works. Despite the challenges I've overcome while working on a Bootstrap project, I recognize there's still much more to learn. While I've grasped the fundamentals of Bootstrap's framework and its application in creating responsive designs, I want to perfect this craft. Additionally, I was told i have a keen eye for design and that continues to drive me to refine and enhance the aesthetic appeal of the interfaces I develop. Trying to balance functionality with visual appeal remains a constant pursuit, as I strive to create user experiences that are not only intuitive but also visually compelling.


SBA 308

This project had me STRESSED. Although it was not much challenging requirement, it was difficult finding an Api that worked. Being that both SBA 326 and SBA 308 could be done togehter, my initial project was about Dogs. I tried using the avaliable APIs for Dogs but neither was working for me or i couldnt get it to work. Therefore i reverted to an Marvel Api. I was able to make it work but it was still difficult to try to get done exactly what I wanted. All that being said im still proud of the work I've done.
